Question 2:
Experiment with Unix tools to analyze the MBTA Commuter Rail schedule data file by doing:

    ln -s ~dce-lib113/sched.errs sched

    This version of the file contains several errors. These are not factual errors such as
    incorrect arrival time. Instead they are data entry errors such as incorrect tag names
    or bad data format. See how many errors you can find in this file. Create a plain text
    file called errors that lists all the errors you find. Also in the errors files,
    describe what tools, procedures, and/or commands you used to find the errors.

Tools/Commands used: - cat:
used to output file for viewing and getting a general
sense of the format - less:
same as cat, but outputs less text at a time, which makes
it easier to look over without being overwhelmed

    - grep:
    	used to extract strings from text

    - cut:
    	cut out portions of a string from text using delimiters

Errors or issues observed:

    - based on the following command:
    		“cat sched | cut -d";" -f1 | less”
    	it appears that the the “TR=num” column is supposed to be ordered from least to greatest,
    	but there seems to be portions that are not properly arranged.

    - based on the following command:
    		“cat sched | cut -d”;” -f3”
    	it appears that data was misentered, as there is a line that accidentally combines
    	the schedule and the time, e.g. “day=suTI=15:06”

    - based on the following command:
    		“cat sched | cut -d”;” -f5”
    	The format “stn=name” was not followed for one of the
    	entries, i.e “Line=franklin”

    - based on the following command:
    		“cat sched | cut -d”;” -f6”
    	The format “Line=name” was erroneously typed as “zn=2” for
    	one of the entries
